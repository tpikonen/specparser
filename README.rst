Specparser
==========

Introduction
------------

Specparser is a Python module providing, as the name implies, a parser
for the data files produced by the instrument control software spec_ by
*Certified Scientific Software*. It is pure Python and does not have
dependencies outside of the Python standard library.

.. _spec: http://www.certif.com/

Example usage
-------------

The parser is initialized by giving a file object containing the spec
data file as an argument.

 >>> import specparser
 >>> fid = open('testdata/oneline.spec')
 >>> p = specparser.Specparser(fid)

A Python representation of the full spec data file can be obtained with
the `parse` method.

 >>> scans = p.parse()

The result is a multi-valued dictionary, with scan numbers as keys.
Usually there is only one scan in the SPEC file with a single scan
number. In this case, the scans can be accessed with the syntax
scan[number].

 >>> scans[1].keys()
 ['ncols', 'motors', 'number', 'comments', 'time_units', 'date', 'command', 'time', 'npoints', 'unknown_headers', 'counters', 'counting-to', 'fourc', 'columns', 'hklstart']
 >>> scans[1]['counters'].keys()
 ['Monitor', 'Seconds', 'H', 'K', 'Two Theta', 'Epoch', 'Detector 2', 'Detector 3', 'Detector']
 >>> scans[1]['counters']['Detector']
 [1.0]

The scans can also be accessed with the syntax scans[number, index], in
case there are more than one scan with the same number. Here number is
the scan number and index is the repeat of the scan in the SPEC file,
i.e.  scan[123, 0] is the first scan in the file with number 123,
scan[123, 1] is the second etc.

 >>> scans[1,0]['counters']['Detector']
 [1.0]

API
---

Methods header(), next_scan(), next_scan_header(), and next_point() can
be used to read a spec-file incrementally. A typical use case would be
reading the scans or scan points immediately when they are created.

See the code and docstrings for details.
